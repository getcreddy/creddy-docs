# Integrations

Creddy connects to external services to issue ephemeral, scoped credentials. Each integration is distributed as a plugin that can be installed and updated independently.

## Available Integrations

## Installing Integrations

List available integrations:

```bash
creddy plugin list
```

Install an integration:

```bash
# Install latest version
creddy plugin install github

# Install specific version
creddy plugin install github@0.0.2

# Install multiple
creddy plugin install github anthropic doppler
```

## Managing Integrations

Check for updates:

```bash
creddy plugin outdated
```

Upgrade:

```bash
# Upgrade specific integration
creddy plugin upgrade github

# Upgrade all
creddy plugin upgrade --all
```

View details:

```bash
creddy plugin info github
```

Remove:

```bash
creddy plugin remove github
```

## Using Integrations

Once installed, add the backend configuration:

```bash
# Example: GitHub
creddy backend add github \
  --app-id 123456 \
  --installation-id 78901234 \
  --private-key /path/to/app.pem
```

Then request credentials:

```bash
creddy get github --scope "github:myorg/myrepo"
```

Each integration has its own configuration and scopes — see the individual integration pages for details.

## Custom & Private Integrations

Install from a URL for private or custom integrations:

```bash
creddy plugin install https://internal.corp/creddy-salesforce.tar.gz
```

See [Building Custom Integrations](/docs/integrations/building) to create your own.

## Third-Party Integrations

Third-party integrations are created by the community. Before installing:

- ✅ Review the source code
- ✅ Check the publisher
- ✅ Verify checksums if provided

Third-party integrations run as subprocesses and receive the configuration you provide, but cannot access other backends or Creddy's database directly.
