# Anthropic Integration

Creddy's Anthropic integration creates truly ephemeral API keys. Unlike static keys, these are created on-demand and automatically deleted when they expire or when an agent is unenrolled.

## How It Works

Creddy uses Anthropic's Admin API to manage API keys programmatically:

1. Agent requests `creddy get anthropic`
2. Creddy creates a new API key via Admin API
3. Returns real `sk-ant-...` key to the agent
4. On TTL expiry or unenroll → Creddy deletes the key from Anthropic

```
┌─────────────┐    creddy get anthropic    ┌─────────────┐
│   Agent     │ ─────────────────────────▶ │   Creddy    │
│             │ ◀───────────────────────── │   Server    │
└─────────────┘    sk-ant-xxx (1h TTL)     └──────┬──────┘
       │                                          │
       │ claude / API calls                       │ Admin API
       ▼                                          ▼
┌─────────────┐                            ┌─────────────┐
│  Anthropic  │                            │  Anthropic  │
│     API     │                            │  Admin API  │
└─────────────┘                            └─────────────┘
```

The key difference from GitHub: **the agent gets a real API key** that works with any client (Claude Code, SDKs, curl), but Creddy automatically cleans it up.

## Requirements

- **Anthropic Admin API access** — Requires Scale or Enterprise plan
- **Admin API key** — Generated from your Anthropic console

## Installation

```bash
creddy plugin install anthropic
```

## Server Setup

### 1. Get Admin API Key

1. Log into [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com)
2. Go to Settings → Admin API
3. Generate an Admin API key
4. Save it securely — it won't be shown again

### 2. Configure Creddy

Add to your Creddy config (`~/.creddy/config.yaml`):

```yaml
integrations:
  anthropic:
    plugin: creddy-anthropic
    config:
      admin_key: "sk-admin-..."
```

Or via CLI:

```bash
creddy backend add anthropic \
  --admin-key "sk-admin-..."
```

Or via API:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8400/v1/admin/backends \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "anthropic",
    "name": "anthropic",
    "config": {
      "admin_key": "sk-admin-..."
    }
  }'
```

## Agent Enrollment

Agents request Anthropic access during enrollment:

```bash
creddy enroll --server http://creddy:8400 --name my-agent \
  --can anthropic
```

Currently, Anthropic scopes are simple — an agent either has access or doesn't. Future versions may support model-level scoping.

## Requesting Keys

Once enrolled and approved:

```bash
# Get an API key (default 10 min TTL)
creddy get anthropic

# Get a key with custom TTL
creddy get anthropic --ttl 1h

# Use it immediately
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=$(creddy get anthropic)
claude "Hello, world"
```

### Using with Claude Code

```bash
# Set the key
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=$(creddy get anthropic --ttl 1h)

# Claude Code uses it automatically
claude code "implement a fibonacci function"
```

### Using with Python SDK

```python
import os
import anthropic

# Key from environment (set via creddy get)
client = anthropic.Anthropic()

message = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-sonnet-20240229",
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
)
```

## Key Lifecycle

### TTL Expiry

Keys are automatically deleted when their TTL expires:

```bash
# Request a 30-minute key
creddy get anthropic --ttl 30m

# After 30 minutes, Creddy's reaper:
# 1. Calls Anthropic Admin API to delete the key
# 2. Removes it from the active credentials database
```

The agent cannot use the key after expiry — it's deleted from Anthropic, not just Creddy.

### Agent Unenroll

When an agent is unenrolled, all their active keys are revoked:

```bash
# Admin unenrolls an agent
creddy unenroll my-agent

# Creddy:
# 1. Finds all active credentials for my-agent
# 2. Deletes each Anthropic key via Admin API
# 3. Removes the agent
```

This provides immediate revocation — no waiting for TTL expiry.

## Audit Trail

All key creation is logged:

```bash
creddy audit --limit 10
```

Shows who requested keys, when, and which agent.

## Security Considerations

### Admin Key Security

The Admin API key stored in Creddy can create and delete any API key in your organization. Protect it:

- Run Creddy on a trusted server (Tailscale, VPN, localhost)
- Use `creddy install` with security hardening
- Rotate the admin key periodically

### Key Visibility

Unlike GitHub tokens (which are scoped), Anthropic API keys have full access to your API quota. Consider:

- Short TTLs for untrusted agents
- Monitoring API usage per key name (`creddy-<timestamp>`)
- Using separate Anthropic organizations for different trust levels

## Comparison with Static Keys

| Aspect | Static Key | Creddy Ephemeral |
|--------|-----------|------------------|
| Lifetime | Forever | Minutes to hours |
| Revocation | Manual | Automatic on TTL/unenroll |
| Audit | None | Full trail |
| Agent compromise | Permanent exposure | Limited window |
| Key rotation | Manual | Automatic |

## Troubleshooting

### "Admin API access required"

You need a Scale or Enterprise plan for Admin API access. Contact Anthropic sales.

### "Failed to create API key"

Check that your admin key is valid and has permission to create API keys.

### Key not working

Verify the key was created successfully:

```bash
# Check active credentials
creddy list
```

If the key shows as active but doesn't work, the Admin API endpoint may have changed. Check Anthropic's documentation.
