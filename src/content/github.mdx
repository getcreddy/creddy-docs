# GitHub Integration

Creddy's GitHub integration provides scoped, ephemeral installation tokens for your AI agents. Instead of sharing personal access tokens, agents request short-lived tokens with access to only the repositories they need.

## How It Works

Creddy uses a [GitHub App](https://docs.github.com/en/apps) to generate installation tokens. When an agent requests a GitHub credential:

1. Agent authenticates with Creddy using its agent token
2. Creddy validates the agent's scopes (which repos it can access)
3. Creddy generates a GitHub App installation token scoped to those repos
4. Token is returned to the agent (expires in 1 hour max)

```
┌─────────────┐     creddy get github      ┌─────────────┐
│   Agent     │ ─────────────────────────▶ │   Creddy    │
│             │ ◀───────────────────────── │   Server    │
└─────────────┘     ghs_xxxxx (1h TTL)     └──────┬──────┘
       │                                          │
       │ git clone / gh api                       │ GitHub App
       ▼                                          ▼
┌─────────────┐                            ┌─────────────┐
│   GitHub    │ ◀────────────────────────── │  GitHub App │
│   (repos)   │                            └─────────────┘
└─────────────┘
```

## Key Concepts

Before setup, understand these key points:

- **One GitHub App** — Create a single GitHub App that Creddy uses to generate tokens
- **Install per org/user** — Install the app into each GitHub org or user account where agents need access
- **Max permissions on app** — The GitHub App needs the *maximum* permissions any agent might request. Creddy can only reduce permissions, never expand beyond what the app has.
- **No webhooks needed** — Creddy only generates tokens; it doesn't receive events from GitHub

## Server Setup

### 1. Create a GitHub App

1. Go to [github.com/settings/apps/new](https://github.com/settings/apps/new)

2. **Basic info:**
   - **Name**: `creddy-yourcompany` (must be globally unique)
   - **Homepage URL**: Your Creddy server URL (or any URL)

3. **Webhook:**
   - ❌ **Uncheck "Active"** — Creddy doesn't need webhooks

4. **Permissions** — Set the *maximum* any agent might need:
   
   | Permission | Level | Use Case |
   |------------|-------|----------|
   | Contents | Read & Write | Clone, push, read files |
   | Metadata | Read | Required for all operations |
   | Pull requests | Read & Write | Create/manage PRs |
   | Issues | Read & Write | Create/manage issues |
   | Actions | Read | Check workflow status |
   | Commit statuses | Read & Write | Set status checks |

   Start with Contents + Metadata. Add more as needed.

5. **Where can this app be installed?**
   - "Only on this account" for private use
   - "Any account" if agents need access across orgs

6. **Create the app** and note the **App ID** (shown at top of app settings)

7. **Generate a private key:**
   - Scroll to "Private keys" section
   - Click "Generate a private key"
   - Downloads a `.pem` file — keep this secure!

### 2. Install the App

1. From your app's settings page, click **"Install App"** in the sidebar
2. Choose the org or user account to install on
3. Select **"All repositories"** or specific repos
4. Click **Install**
5. Note the **Installation ID** from the URL:
   ```
   https://github.com/settings/installations/12345678
                                              ^^^^^^^^
                                              This is your installation ID
   ```

Repeat for each org where agents need access.

### 3. Configure Creddy

```bash
# Add the GitHub backend
creddy backend add github \
  --app-id 123456 \
  --installation-id 12345678 \
  --private-key /path/to/app.pem
```

Or via API:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8400/v1/admin/backends \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "github",
    "name": "github",
    "config": {
      "app_id": 123456,
      "installation_id": 12345678,
      "private_key_pem": "-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n..."
    }
  }'
```

## Agent Enrollment

Agents request access to specific repositories during enrollment:

```bash
# Agent requests enrollment with repo access
creddy enroll http://creddy-server:8400 --name my-agent \
  --can github:owner/repo1 \
  --can github:owner/repo2
```

### Scope Format

| Scope | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `github:owner/repo` | Access to a specific repository (read/write) |
| `github:owner/repo:read` | Read-only access to a repository |
| `github:owner/repo:write` | Explicit read/write access |
| `github:owner/*` | Access to all repos under an owner |
| `github:*` | Access to all repos the app can see |

### Read-Only Scopes

Suffix `:read` to restrict an agent to read-only access:

```bash
creddy enroll http://creddy-server:8400 --name ci-bot \
  --can github:myorg/frontend:read \
  --can github:myorg/backend:read
```

This agent can only request read-only tokens—even if it tries `--read-only=false`, Creddy will enforce the ceiling.

## Requesting Tokens

Once enrolled and approved, agents can request tokens:

```bash
# Get a token for all your repos
creddy get github

# Get a read-only token
creddy get github --read-only

# Narrow to specific repos (subset of what you're allowed)
creddy get github --repo owner/repo1

# Custom TTL (max 1 hour)
creddy get github --ttl 30m
```

### Using the Token

The returned token works with any GitHub API client:

```bash
# Set the token
export GITHUB_TOKEN=$(creddy get github)

# Use with git
git clone https://x-access-token:${GITHUB_TOKEN}@github.com/owner/repo.git

# Use with gh CLI
gh api repos/owner/repo

# Use with curl
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/owner/repo
```

## Adding More Repos Later

Agents can request additional repository access after enrollment:

```bash
# Agent requests more access
creddy request --can github:owner/repo3

# On the server, admin sees the request
creddy pending
# ID          TYPE        NAME        SCOPES
# abc-123     amendment   my-agent    ["github:owner/repo3"]

# Admin approves
creddy approve abc-123
```

Scopes are merged—the agent now has access to repo1, repo2, and repo3.

## Multi-Organization Setup

GitHub App installation tokens are scoped to a single installation (typically one org or user account). If your agents need access to repos across multiple orgs:

1. Install the GitHub App on each org
2. Configure multiple backends in Creddy:
   ```bash
   creddy backend add github-myorg --app-id 123 --installation-id 111 --private-key app.pem
   creddy backend add github-partner --app-id 123 --installation-id 222 --private-key app.pem
   ```
3. Agents request from the appropriate backend:
   ```bash
   creddy get github-myorg
   creddy get github-partner
   ```

## Token Permissions

The token inherits the permissions configured on your GitHub App, reduced by any scope restrictions:

| App Permission | Agent Scope | Token Gets |
|----------------|-------------|------------|
| Contents: Write | `github:owner/repo` | Contents: Write |
| Contents: Write | `github:owner/repo:read` | Contents: Read |
| Contents: Read | `github:owner/repo` | Contents: Read |

You cannot grant more permissions than the app has—Creddy only reduces, never expands.

## Audit Trail

Every token issued is logged:

```bash
creddy audit --limit 10
```

Shows who requested what, when, and from where—useful for security reviews and compliance.
