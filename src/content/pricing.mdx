## Why Free?

Credential management for AI agents is a fundamental security need. We believe every developer building with AI agents should have access to proper credential isolation without cost being a barrier.

Creddy is built and maintained by developers who believe in open source infrastructure for the AI ecosystem.

## Self-Hosted Only

Creddy runs on your infrastructure. There's no hosted version and no plans for one. This means:

- **Your secrets stay yours** — credentials never leave your network
- **No vendor lock-in** — switch or fork anytime
- **Full control** — customize to your needs
