# Creddy

**Ephemeral credentials for AI agents.**

Creddy provides short-lived, scoped credentials for AI agents and automated systems. Instead of sharing long-lived API keys or passwords, Creddy generates temporary credentials that automatically expire—reducing risk and improving auditability.

## Why Creddy?

Traditional credential management wasn't designed for the age of AI agents. When you give an agent access to your systems, you typically have two bad options:

1. **Share your credentials** — The agent now has your full access, forever
2. **Create long-lived API keys** — Better, but still risky if compromised

Creddy offers a third way: **ephemeral, scoped credentials** that exist only as long as needed.

## Key Features

- 🔐 **Ephemeral by default** — Credentials expire automatically (minutes to hours, not months)
- 🎯 **Scoped access** — Grant only the permissions needed for the task
- 📊 **Auditable** — Track every credential issued and used
- 🤖 **Built for agents** — Simple API designed for programmatic access
- 🔑 **Signed tokens** — Cryptographically signed JWTs for verification

## How It Works

```
┌─────────────┐     1. Request credential      ┌─────────────┐
│   Agent     │ ─────────────────────────────▶ │   Creddy    │
│             │ ◀───────────────────────────── │   Server    │
└─────────────┘     2. Short-lived token       └─────────────┘
       │
       │ 3. Use token

┌─────────────┐
│  External   │
│  Service    │
└─────────────┘
```

1. Agent requests a credential for a specific backend (e.g., "github", "aws")
2. Creddy issues a signed, time-limited token
3. Agent uses the token to authenticate with the external service
4. Token expires automatically — no cleanup needed

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install creddy
go install github.com/getcreddy/creddy@latest

# Start the server
creddy server

# Request a credential (from your agent)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/credentials \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"backend": "github", "ttl": "1h"}'
```
