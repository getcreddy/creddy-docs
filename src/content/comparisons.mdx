# Comparisons

Creddy often gets compared to other secrets management tools. Here's how it differs.

## The Short Version

Creddy is **not** a general-purpose secrets manager. It's a narrow, focused tool for one thing: **giving AI agents isolated, ephemeral credentials**.

If you're managing production infrastructure secrets, customer data encryption keys, or enterprise compliance requirements — use Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or similar tools. They're excellent at what they do.

Creddy is for a different problem: you have AI agents that need API access, and you don't want to hand them your personal tokens.

## Creddy vs HashiCorp Vault

[Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) is an enterprise-grade secrets management platform.

| | Vault | Creddy |
|---|---|---|
| **Primary use case** | Production infrastructure secrets | AI agent credentials |
| **Complexity** | High (requires ops expertise) | Low (single binary) |
| **Target users** | Platform/DevOps teams | Individual developers, AI agents |
| **Secrets storage** | Yes, stores all secrets | No, connects to existing APIs |
| **Dynamic secrets** | Many backends (databases, cloud, etc.) | Focused backends (GitHub, Anthropic, etc.) |
| **Compliance** | SOC2, HIPAA, etc. | Not designed for compliance |
| **Deployment** | Cluster, HA, unsealing | Single binary, SQLite |

**When to use Vault:** Production secrets, database credentials, PKI, enterprise requirements.

**When to use Creddy:** Giving Claude Code a GitHub token that expires in 10 minutes.

They solve different problems. Many teams will use both.

## Creddy vs Cloud Secrets Managers

AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager, Azure Key Vault — these are cloud-native secrets storage.

| | Cloud Secrets Managers | Creddy |
|---|---|---|
| **Model** | Store and retrieve secrets | Generate ephemeral credentials |
| **Vendor** | Cloud provider lock-in | Self-hosted, provider agnostic |
| **Agent identity** | Not a focus | Core feature |
| **Credential scoping** | Manual, per-secret | Automatic, per-agent |
| **Cost** | Per-secret, per-request pricing | Free |

**When to use cloud secrets managers:** Production apps on that cloud, team secret sharing.

**When to use Creddy:** You want agents to have their own scoped identities, not access to a shared secret store.

## Creddy vs Doppler

[Doppler](https://www.doppler.com/) is a secrets management platform for development teams.

| | Doppler | Creddy |
|---|---|---|
| **Focus** | Team secrets sync, env management | Agent credential isolation |
| **Model** | Centralized secrets store | Ephemeral credential broker |
| **Pricing** | Free tier, then paid | Free forever (Apache 2.0) |
| **Hosting** | SaaS | Self-hosted only |
| **Agent identity** | Not a focus | Core feature |

**When to use Doppler:** Syncing environment variables across your team and CI/CD.

**When to use Creddy:** Giving each AI agent its own isolated credentials with automatic expiry.

*Note: Creddy can actually issue Doppler service tokens as one of its backends — they complement each other.*

## Creddy vs Environment Variables / .env Files

The simplest approach: put tokens in `.env` and let agents use them.

| | .env files | Creddy |
|---|---|---|
| **Setup** | Instant | Minutes |
| **Agent isolation** | ❌ All agents share credentials | ✅ Each agent gets unique credentials |
| **Credential expiry** | ❌ Tokens live forever | ✅ Automatic TTL |
| **Audit trail** | ❌ No visibility | ✅ Full logging |
| **Blast radius** | 🔴 Compromised token = full access | 🟢 Compromised token = limited scope, auto-expires |

**When to use .env:** Quick experiments, trusted environments, single-agent setups.

**When to use Creddy:** Multiple agents, any concern about credential exposure, need for auditability.

## What Creddy Is Not

To be clear about Creddy's scope:

- ❌ **Not a secrets store** — doesn't store your master credentials (you configure backends separately)
- ❌ **Not for production data** — don't use it for customer encryption keys or database passwords
- ❌ **Not enterprise software** — no HA clustering, no compliance certifications
- ❌ **Not a Vault replacement** — if you need Vault, you need Vault

## What Creddy Is

- ✅ **Agent-native** — built specifically for AI agent workflows
- ✅ **Ephemeral by default** — credentials expire automatically
- ✅ **Scoped access** — agents only get what they need
- ✅ **Simple** — single binary, runs anywhere
- ✅ **Free** — Apache 2.0, no limits
