# Getting Started

Get Creddy up and running in minutes.

## Installation

### Quick Install (Recommended)

The install script automatically detects your OS and architecture, downloads the correct binary, verifies the checksum, and installs it:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.creddy.dev/install.sh | sh
```

This installs to `/usr/local/bin/creddy` (or `~/.creddy/bin/creddy` if you don't have sudo access).

**Install a specific version:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.creddy.dev/install.sh | sh -s -- v0.0.2
```

### Manual Download

Download binaries directly from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/getcreddy/creddy/releases):

```bash
# macOS (Apple Silicon)
curl -LO https://github.com/getcreddy/creddy/releases/latest/download/creddy-darwin-arm64
chmod +x creddy-darwin-arm64
sudo mv creddy-darwin-arm64 /usr/local/bin/creddy

# macOS (Intel)
curl -LO https://github.com/getcreddy/creddy/releases/latest/download/creddy-darwin-amd64
chmod +x creddy-darwin-amd64
sudo mv creddy-darwin-amd64 /usr/local/bin/creddy

# Linux (amd64)
curl -LO https://github.com/getcreddy/creddy/releases/latest/download/creddy-linux-amd64
chmod +x creddy-linux-amd64
sudo mv creddy-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/creddy

# Linux (arm64)
curl -LO https://github.com/getcreddy/creddy/releases/latest/download/creddy-linux-arm64
chmod +x creddy-linux-arm64
sudo mv creddy-linux-arm64 /usr/local/bin/creddy
```

### From Source (Not Recommended)

If you have Go installed, you can build from source. Note that this won't include version information in the binary:

```bash
go install github.com/getcreddy/creddy@latest
```

## Starting the Server

```bash
creddy server
```

By default, Creddy runs on `http://localhost:8080`.

### Configuration Options

```bash
# Custom port
creddy server --port 9000

# Custom data directory
creddy server --data-dir /var/lib/creddy
```

## Your First Credential

Once the server is running, request a credential:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/credentials \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "backend": "github",
    "ttl": "1h",
    "scopes": ["repo:read"]
  }'
```

Response:

```json
{
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
  "expires_at": "2024-01-15T16:00:00Z",
  "backend": "github",
  "scopes": ["repo:read"]
}
```

## Configuring Backends

Backends are the external services Creddy can issue credentials for. Configure them in `~/.creddy/config.yaml`:

```yaml
backends:
  github:
    type: github
    token: ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxx
    
  aws:
    type: aws
    access_key_id: AKIA...
    secret_access_key: ...
    region: us-east-1
```

See [Concepts](/docs/concepts) for more on how backends work.
