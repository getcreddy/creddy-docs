# Getting Started

Creddy has two components: a **server** that holds your secrets and issues credentials, and a **client** that agents use to request them.

## Quick Overview

| Component | Who runs it | Install location |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| **Server** | You (once, on a VPS or local machine) | `/usr/local/bin/creddy` |
| **Client** | Each agent/machine that needs credentials | `~/.local/bin/creddy` |

Both use the same `creddy` binary — the difference is how you install and run it.

---

## Client Setup

Install the CLI on machines that need to request credentials:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.creddy.dev/install.sh | sh
```

This installs to `~/.local/bin/creddy` (no sudo required).

### Enroll with a Server

Before requesting credentials, enroll with your Creddy server:

```bash
creddy enroll https://your-server:8400
```

You'll get a one-time code to approve on the server. After enrollment, credentials are stored in `~/.config/creddy/`.

### Request Credentials

```bash
# GitHub token with repo access
creddy get github --owner myorg --repo myrepo --ttl 1h

# Use in scripts
export GITHUB_TOKEN=$(creddy get github --owner myorg --repo myrepo -o token)
```

### Install Plugins

Plugins add support for different credential types:

```bash
creddy plugin install github
creddy plugin list
```

---

## Server Setup

Run the server on a machine you control (VPS, homelab, etc.).

### Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.creddy.dev/install.sh | sudo sh -s -- --to /usr/local/bin
```

This installs to `/usr/local/bin/creddy` with sudo.

### Start as a Daemon

```bash
sudo creddy install --listen 0.0.0.0:8400
```

This creates a systemd service that:
- Runs on port 8400
- Stores data in `/var/lib/creddy`
- Starts automatically on boot

**Manage the service:**

```bash
systemctl status creddy       # Check status
journalctl -u creddy -f       # View logs
sudo systemctl restart creddy # Restart
```

### Configure Backends

Install and configure plugins on the server:

```bash
sudo creddy plugin install github
creddy backend add github \
  --app-id 123456 \
  --private-key /path/to/key.pem \
  --installation-id 789
```
