# Getting Started

Creddy is a single binary that operates in two modes: as a **server** that holds secrets and issues credentials, and as a **client** that agents use to request them.

Get it running and issue your first credential in 5 minutes.

## 1. Install the Server

On your server (VPS, homelab, etc.):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.creddy.dev/install.sh | sudo sh -s -- --to /usr/local/bin
```

## 2. Start the Daemon

```bash
sudo creddy install --listen 0.0.0.0:8400
```

Creddy is now running as a systemd service on port 8400.

```bash
systemctl status creddy  # Check it's running
```

## 3. Add a Backend

Install the GitHub plugin and configure it:

```bash
sudo creddy plugin install github
```

```bash
creddy backend add github \
  --app-id YOUR_APP_ID \
  --private-key /path/to/private-key.pem \
  --installation-id YOUR_INSTALLATION_ID
```

> **Need a GitHub App?** See [GitHub Integration](/docs/integrations/github) for setup instructions.

## 4. Enroll a Client

On the machine that needs credentials (can be the same machine or a different one):

```bash
# Install the client
curl -fsSL https://get.creddy.dev/install.sh | sh

# Enroll with the server
creddy enroll https://your-server:8400
```

Approve the enrollment on the server:

```bash
creddy admin approve <enrollment-id>
```

## 5. Get Credentials

```bash
creddy get github --owner myorg --repo myrepo
```

That's it! You've issued your first ephemeral credential.
