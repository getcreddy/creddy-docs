# Third-Party Plugins

Third-party plugins are created by the community or organizations for their own needs. They're not maintained by the Creddy team.

## Using Third-Party Plugins

Install from a URL:

```bash
# From a GitHub release
creddy plugin install https://github.com/someone/creddy-salesforce/releases/download/v0.1.0/creddy-salesforce-linux-amd64.tar.gz

# From a private registry
creddy plugin install https://plugins.internal.corp/creddy-internal-auth
```

## Security Considerations

⚠️ **Third-party plugins run as subprocesses with access to your Creddy configuration.**

Before installing a third-party plugin:

1. **Review the source code** — Only install plugins from sources you trust
2. **Check the publisher** — Is this a known developer/organization?
3. **Verify checksums** — If provided, verify the download matches
4. **Start with read-only** — Test with minimal scopes first
5. **Monitor behavior** — Watch for unexpected network calls or file access

### What plugins can access

Plugins receive:
- Configuration you provide (API keys, tokens, etc.)
- Agent information (ID, name, scopes)
- Credential requests (scope, TTL)

Plugins **cannot** access:
- Other backends' configurations
- Creddy's database directly
- Other plugins

### Network isolation

For high-security environments, consider:

```bash
# Run Creddy with network restrictions
# (implementation depends on your environment)
firejail --net=none creddy server  # Linux
```

## Building Private Plugins

Organizations often need plugins for internal systems. See [Building Plugins](/docs/plugins/building-plugins) for a complete guide.

Common use cases:
- Internal SSO/authentication systems
- Proprietary APIs
- Custom secret stores
- Legacy systems

## Community Plugins

> **Note:** This list is community-maintained. Inclusion doesn't imply endorsement.

| Plugin | Description | Author |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| *None yet* | Be the first! | - |

### Submitting a Plugin

To add your plugin to this list:

1. Ensure it follows the [plugin guidelines](#plugin-guidelines)
2. Open a PR to [getcreddy/creddy-docs](https://github.com/getcreddy/creddy-docs)
3. Add your plugin to the table above

### Plugin Guidelines

Community plugins should:

- ✅ Be open source (or clearly documented)
- ✅ Include a README with setup instructions
- ✅ Specify minimum Creddy version
- ✅ Handle errors gracefully
- ✅ Not collect telemetry without disclosure

## Private Plugin Registries

Organizations can host their own plugin registries:

```bash
# Configure a private registry
creddy config set plugin.registry https://plugins.internal.corp

# Or use environment variable
export CREDDY_PLUGIN_REGISTRY=https://plugins.internal.corp
```

Registry format (JSON):
```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "internal-auth": {
      "description": "Internal authentication system",
      "latest": "0.3.1",
      "versions": {
        "0.3.1": {
          "url": "https://plugins.internal.corp/internal-auth/0.3.1/{os}-{arch}.tar.gz",
          "sha256": {
            "linux-amd64": "abc123...",
            "darwin-arm64": "def456..."
          },
          "min_creddy_version": "0.4.0"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Reporting Issues

For security issues with third-party plugins, contact the plugin author directly.

For plugins that violate guidelines or are malicious:
- [Open an issue](https://github.com/getcreddy/creddy/issues) to have them removed from community lists
- We cannot take action against plugins hosted elsewhere
